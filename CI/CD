Key Components of the CI/CD Pipeline
Version Control Integration

Developers push changes to a GitHub repository (feature branch).
Code changes are validated and merged through Pull Requests (PR).
GitHub Actions automatically trigger workflows on PR completion.
Workflow Automation

Pipeline Triggers:
Code push to feature branches.
Pull request events.
Steps in the GitHub Actions Workflow:
Code Validation:
Linting and formatting checks (e.g., pre-commit hooks).
Unit Tests Execution:
Ensure all test cases pass before deployment.
Databricks Asset Bundling:
Package notebooks, libraries, and dependencies into deployable bundles.
Deployment to Databricks:
Use Databricks CLI to upload assets to the development workspace.
Deploy and run workflows (jobs).
Deployment Process

Artifact Deployment:
Bundled artifacts (notebooks, Python scripts, libraries) are uploaded to an S3 bucket or Artifactory for storage.
Databricks Job Execution:
Jobs are triggered in the Databricks Dev environment to validate changes.
