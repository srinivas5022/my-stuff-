Subject: Request for Quick Connect on Databricks and Neo4j Integration

Hi Amanda,

I hope you're doing well.

This is Srinivas Reddy, reporting to Sentmeir Dawn. We are currently working on a POC/use case to establish a connection between Databricks and a Neo4j instance to build a knowledge graph.

We recently learned that your team has done some great work in this area, and we would appreciate the opportunity to connect with you and your team for a quick discussion. Your insights and guidance would be invaluable in helping us better understand the process and best practices.

Please let us know a convenient time for a brief call. Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Srinivas Reddy
