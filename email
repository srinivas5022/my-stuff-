Due to the ongoing challenges we are currently facing, I would like to inform you of a potential impact on the quality of our demo scheduled for tomorrow. While significant progress has been made, we are encountering issues that require additional time for thorough testing and validation of the new functionalities.

To ensure that the demo meets the expected standards and provides a seamless experience, I kindly request that we treat this as a partial red flag and consider moving the demo to next week. This extension will allow us to address the identified issues and retest all functionalities comprehensively.

Please let me know your thoughts or if you'd like to discuss this further. Your understanding and support in maintaining the quality of our deliverables are greatly appreciated.
