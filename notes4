Epic: A/B Testing Framework Development
Summary:
Develop an automated A/B Testing Framework in Databricks, integrated with GitHub Actions, to enable efficient testing, comparison, and visualization of experimental datasets.

User Story 1: Setup A/B Testing Framework with GitHub Actions
Title: Setup CI/CD for A/B Testing Framework using GitHub Actions

Description:
As a data engineer,
I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying Databricks notebooks using GitHub Actions,
so that I can automate the deployment process for 1_main_table and notebooks_stage notebooks efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

A CI.yml file exists in the repository to automate the deployment of Databricks notebooks.
The CI pipeline bundles and deploys notebooks using Databricks asset bundling.
Pipeline logs are available for debugging failed deployments.
User Story 2: Automate Workflow Execution for A/B Testing
Title: Create Workflows for A/B Testing Notebooks

Description:
As a data engineer,
I want to automate the execution of workflows for 1_main_table and notebooks_stage,
so that I can compare the outputs of both notebooks and store the results in a Delta table.

Acceptance Criteria:

A workflow for the 1_main_table notebook is set up in Databricks.
A workflow for the notebooks_stage notebook is set up in Databricks.
A Delta table is created to store the comparison results between the two workflows.
Logs for the workflow executions are accessible for monitoring and debugging.
User Story 3: Implement Data Comparison for A/B Testing
Title: Add Data Comparison Logic to A/B Testing Framework

Description:
As a data scientist,
I want to implement comparison logic to validate rows and columns between the A/B datasets,
so that I can evaluate differences between the two variants accurately.

Acceptance Criteria:

The comparison logic validates the number of rows in A and B datasets.
The comparison logic validates the column structures in A and B datasets.
Any mismatches in rows or columns are logged for further analysis.
Results are saved to a Delta table with details of the comparison.
User Story 4: Create Dashboards for A/B Testing Results
Title: Build Dashboards for A/B Testing Outputs

Description:
As a business analyst,
I want to create dashboards in Databricks to visualize A/B testing results,
so that I can easily interpret and share findings with stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria:

A Databricks dashboard is created to display key metrics from A/B testing results.
The dashboard includes visualizations for row and column comparison metrics.
Results from the Delta table are automatically updated on the dashboard.
Dashboards are accessible to relevant stakeholders with appropriate permissions.
Additional Notes
Dependencies:

Ensure that Databricks CLI and GitHub Actions are properly configured for deployment.
Databricks permissions should be set for Delta table creation and dashboard access.
Future Enhancements:

Add support for more variants in the A/B framework.
Include advanced statistical analysis of results.

User Story: Implement Data Comparison for A/B Testing
Title: Add Data Comparison Logic with Validation Criteria for A/B Testing Framework

Description:
As a data scientist,
I want to implement data comparison logic to validate row and column differences between the A/B datasets,
so that I can identify variances in data structure and content between the baseline and test line datasets.

Acceptance Criteria:
Row Count Validation:

The system should validate the number of rows in the baseline and test line datasets.
Expected variance:
Baseline row count: 100
Test line row count: 105
Any mismatches in row counts should be logged for further analysis.
Column Count Validation:

The system should validate the number of columns in the baseline and test line datasets.
Expected variance:
Baseline column count: 2
Test line column count: 3
Any mismatches in column counts should be logged for further analysis.
Column Names Comparison:

The system should compare the column names in the baseline and test line datasets.
Expected results:
Baseline column names: ["id", "name"]
Test line column names: ["id", "name", "age"]
Any discrepancies in column names should be logged for further analysis.
Result Storage:

The comparison results, including row count variances, column count variances, and column name discrepancies, should be saved in a Delta table for future reference and analysis.
Debugging and Monitoring:

Logs for the validation process should be accessible to enable debugging and monitoring of the comparison logic.
Implementation Steps:
Row Count Validation Logic:

Write a function to count the rows in both datasets and compute the variance.
If the variance exceeds the expected limit (5 rows in this case), log the discrepancy.
Column Count Validation Logic:

Write a function to count the columns in both datasets and compute the variance.
If the variance exceeds the expected difference (1 column in this case), log the discrepancy.
Column Name Comparison Logic:

Write a function to compare the column names in both datasets.
Identify any additional or missing column names in the test dataset compared to the baseline dataset.
Delta Table Integration:

Save the results of the row count, column count, and column name comparisons in a Delta table.
Testing and Deployment:

Test the comparison logic with sample datasets to ensure the logic works as expected.
Deploy the comparison logic to the A/B Testing Framework.
