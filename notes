Prerequisites for Developer Access
The following are the tools and assumptions required for developers to work on creating Databricks applications using the SPARTA Framework.

1. Desktop Developer Tools
Purpose: Ensure developers have a consistent environment for building, testing, and deploying Databricks applications using SPARTA.
2. Required Tools and Software
Visual Studio Code:

Lightweight code editor for editing Python, YAML, and configuration files.
Recommended Extensions: Python, YAML, and Git extensions for enhanced productivity.
Git CLI:

For managing source control and performing Git operations directly from the command line.
Ensure proper configuration of Git username, email, and authentication (e.g., SSH keys or personal access tokens).
Databricks CLI:

Used for automating interactions with Databricks workspace via command line.
Setup: Configure Databricks CLI by running:
bash
Copy code
databricks configure  
Provide the necessary workspace URL and authentication token.
Python (3.8 or later):

Required for developing and testing SPARTA framework applications.
Ensure the necessary libraries are installed by executing:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
SPARTA Framework Components:

Download and install the SPARTA library or modules required for developing Databricks applications.
Follow the SPARTA framework documentation for additional dependencies and configuration.
3. Environment Setup
Operating System: Ensure compatibility with tools (Windows/macOS/Linux).
Access Permissions:
GitHub repository access for cloning SPARTA framework repositories.
Databricks workspace access with appropriate permissions for creating applications and workflows.
Required tokens or credentials to interact with Databricks and other APIs.
Networking:
Verify access to required endpoints (e.g., Databricks REST API, artifact repositories).
4. Testing and Validation
To ensure everything is set up correctly:

Clone the SPARTA repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone <SPARTA-repository-url>  
Validate Databricks CLI connection:
bash
Copy code
databricks workspace ls  
Run sample SPARTA application:
Execute a test SPARTA application or script to confirm dependencies and frameworks are properly configured.
By meeting these prerequisites, developers can efficiently create and deploy Databricks applications using the SPARTA Framework.
