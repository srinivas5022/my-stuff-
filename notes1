Jira user stories for your A/B Testing Framework

Hereâ€™s a set of Jira user stories for your A/B Testing Framework requirements, structured with clear descriptions and acceptance criteria:

User Story 1: Setup A/B Testing Framework with GitHub Actions
Title: Setup CI/CD for A/B Testing Framework using GitHub Actions

Description:
As a data engineer,
I want to set up a CI/CD pipeline for deploying Databricks notebooks using GitHub Actions,
so that I can automate the deployment process for 1_main_table and notebooks_stage notebooks efficiently.

Acceptance Criteria:

A CI.yml file exists in the repository to automate the deployment of Databricks notebooks.
The CI pipeline bundles and deploys notebooks using Databricks asset bundling.
Pipeline logs are available for debugging failed deployments.
User Story 2: Automate Workflow Execution for A/B Testing
Title: Create workflows for A/B Testing Notebooks

Description:
As a data engineer,
I want to automate the execution of workflows for 1_main_table and notebooks_stage,
so that I can compare the outputs of both notebooks and store the results in a Delta table.

Acceptance Criteria:

A workflow for 1_main_table notebook is set up in Databricks.
A workflow for notebooks_stage notebook is set up in Databricks.
A Delta table is created to store the comparison results between the two workflows.
Logs for the workflow executions are accessible for monitoring and debugging.
User Story 3: Implement Data Comparison for A/B Testing
Title: Add Data Comparison Logic to A/B Testing Framework

Description:
As a data scientist,
I want to implement comparison logic to validate rows and columns between the A/B datasets,
so that I can evaluate differences between the two variants accurately.

Acceptance Criteria:

The comparison logic validates the number of rows in A and B.
The comparison logic validates the column structures in A and B.
Any mismatches in rows or columns are logged for further analysis.
Results are saved to a Delta table with details of the comparison.
User Story 4: Create Dashboards for A/B Testing Results
Title: Build Dashboards for A/B Testing Outputs

Description:
As a business analyst,
I want to create dashboards in Databricks to visualize A/B testing results,
so that I can easily interpret and share findings with stakeholders.

Acceptance Criteria:

A Databricks dashboard is created to display key metrics from A/B testing results.
The dashboard includes visualizations for row and column comparison metrics.
Results from the Delta table are automatically updated on the dashboard.
Dashboards are accessible to relevant stakeholders with appropriate permissions.
Epic: A/B Testing Framework Development
Summary:
Build an automated A/B Testing Framework in Databricks, integrated with GitHub Actions, to enable efficient testing, comparison, and visualization of experimental datasets.

Stories:

Setup CI/CD for A/B Testing Framework using GitHub Actions (Story 1).
Automate Workflow Execution for A/B Testing (Story 2).
Implement Data Comparison Logic for A/B Testing (Story 3).
Create Dashboards for A/B Testing Outputs (Story 4).
Additional Notes
Dependencies:

Ensure that Databricks CLI and GitHub Actions are properly configured for deployment.
Databricks permissions should be set for Delta table creation and dashboard access.
Future Enhancements:

Add support for more variants in the A/B framework.
Include advanced statistical analysis of results.
